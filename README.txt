Greetings curious one.

This repository is for a manuscript not-yet-published.

The specific work is the RT-qPCR results in Unknown Figures.

The Packages_Functions.R file contains the necessary libraries and functions to run the analysis scripts. Run it first. This is CURRENTLY (12.02.2022) the same file as in Omura_2022.

Figure_Unknown.R contains the entire code required to import the raw data, perform statistics, generate relative expression values, and graph the results.

Over time, I might clean up some of the code, but perhaps it is best left in its current state as a testiment to my progress.

On 12.02.2022, I will not be providing any of the raw data or the AA10 file without direct communication. I do not know the licensing agreements of the future publisher as of this time, but I will update as I learn more.  

The information surrounding these analysis files, how they reached their current state, and my rationale up to that point- I can make available through direct communication.

Feel free to contact me at genielamp16@gmail.com to comment, question, or criticize my work.
